This project is a passionate endeavor to harness the power of Machine Learning in understanding human preferences through their hobbies and music tastes. By analyzing these aspects, the model aims to recommend new hobbies and music that align with individual interests.

Please note that this project is a work in progress. Although it is not yet feature-complete, I welcome contributions and feedback as I continue to develop and refine it. This is a dream project that I am iterating on as I work through my knowledge gaps.

Thank you for your time and interest. Have a great day!
