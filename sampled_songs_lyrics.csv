With the goons I spar, stay in tune with ma (What up?)
She like, ""Damn, this the realest since 'Kumbaya'""
Bomaye, Killa Cam, my Lord (My Lord)
Still the man with the pan, scrilla, fam, on board
Now bitches, they want to neuter me, niggas, they want to tutor me
The hooligan in Houlihan's, maneuvering's nothing new to me
Doggy, I'm from the land of grind, pan-pan: gram or dime?
Not toes or MC when I say ""hammer time""
Beef: I hammer mine, when I get my hands on nines
If I had on 'Bama line, Corduroys, Cam'll shine
Canary burgundy: I call it ""Lemon Red"" (Red)
Yellow diamonds in my ear, call 'em ""Lemonheads""
Lemonhead, end up dead, ice like Winnipeg
Gemstone, Flintstones, you could say I'm friends with Fred
You unhappy, scrappy? (What's going on, Scrappy?)
I got Pataki at me
Bitches say I'm ""Tacky Daddy,"" Range look like Laffy Taffy

Yo, I'm from where Nicky Barnes got rich as fuck
Rich and A hit the kitchens then were pitchin' up
Rob Base, Mase, Doug E Fresh switched it up
I do both, who am I to fuck tradition up? (Killa!)
So I parked in a tow-away zone
Chrome...I don't care
That car a throwaway, homes (Killa!)
Welcome to Harlem, where you welcome to problems
Off of furlough, fellow felons get pardons
Them niggas knew we bang
Stood out like Pootie Tang
Soon as the stoolie sings
That when the toolie sing!
Bang! Bang!
Came from that movie ring
Snap, crack jewelry bling
Flapjack, ooh he bring
Clack-clack, ""ooh he ring!""
Bad rap, cuties cling
Ass cap, put them in the river
I'm the sushi king
And I'ma keep ya fresh
Let the fish eat ya flesh

How dope is this?
Teach you how to rope a chick
What you want: coke or piff?
Got it all, smoke or sniff? (everything)
And you know my drift
Used to figures, dough and shit (millions)
You a rooster nigga, just a roaster, bitch
And I roast ya bitch
That's how it usually ends
Tell her and her groupie friends
Go get their coochie cleansed
We the moody Gucci, Louis and Pucci men
Escada, Prada
The chopper it got the Uzi lens
Bird's-eye view
The birds I knew flip birds
Bird gangs, it was birds I flew
And word I blew off herb I grew
I would serve on stoops
Now swerve in coupes

Can I Live,rap,JAY-Z,1996,468624,{},"[Produced by Irv Gotti]

[Intro]
Yeah, hah, yeah, Roc-A-Fella
We invite you to somethin' epic, you know?
Well, we hustle out of a sense of hopelessness
Sort of a desperation
Through that desperation, we become addicted
Sort of like the fiends we accustomed to servin'
But we feel we have nothin' to lose
So, we offer you, well, we offer our lives, right?
What do you bring to the table?

[Verse 1]
While I'm watchin' every nigga watchin' me closely
My shit is butter for the bread, they wanna toast me
I keep my head, both of them, where they supposed to be
Hoes'll get you sidetracked, then clapped from close feet
I don't sleep, I'm tired, I feel wired like codeine, these days
A brother gotta admire me from four fiends away
My pain, wish it was quick to see
From sellin' 'caine 'til brains was fried to a fricassee
Can't lie, at the time it never bothered me
At the bar, gettin' my thug on properly
My squad and me lack of respect for authority
Laughin' hard, happy to be escapin' poverty, however brief
I know this game got valleys and peaks
Expectation for dips, for precipitation we stack chips, hardly
The youth I used to be, soon to see a mill'in
No more Big Willie, my game has grown
Prefer you call me William
Illin' for revenues, Rayful Edmond-like
Channel 7 News, round seven jewels, head dead in the mic
Forgettin' all I ever knew, convenient amnesia
""I suggest you call my lawyer, I know the procedure.""
Lock my body, can't trap my mind
Easily explain why we adapt to crime
I'd rather die enormous than live dormant, that's how we on it
Live at the main event, I bet a trip to Maui on it
Presidential suites my residential for the weekend
Confidentially speakin' in codes since I sense you peekin'
The NSX rental, don't be fooled, my game is mental
We both out of town, dog, what you tryin' to get into?
Viva Las Vegas, see ya later at the crap tables
Meet me by the one that starts a G up
This way no Fraud Willies present gamblin' they re-up
And we can have a pleasant time, sippin' margaritas
[Chorus]
Ge-ge-geyeahhh
Can I live?
Can I live?

[Verse 2]
My mind is infested with sick thoughts that circle
Like a Lexus, if driven wrong it's sure to hurt you
Dual level like duplexes, in unity
My crew and me commit atrocities like we got immunity
You guessed it, manifest it
In tangible goods, platinum Rolex'd it
We don't lease, we buy the whole car, as you should
My confederation, dead a nation
Explode on detonation, overload the mind of a said patient
When it boils to steam, it comes to it
We all fiends, gotta do it: even righteous minds go through this
True this, the streets school us to spend our money foolish
Bond with jewelers and watch for intruders
I stepped it up another level, meditated like a Buddhist
Recruited lieutenants with ludicrous dreams of gettin' cream
""Let's do this,"" it gets tedious
So I keep one eye open like CBS — you see me stressed, right?

[Chorus]
Can I live?
Can I live?
Can I live?
Can I live?",3,en,en,en
Forgive Me Father,rap,Fabolous,2003,4743,{},"Maybe cause I'm eatin
And these bastards fiend for they grub
I carry pumps like I serve gasoline to these scrubs
Have you seen my Aston leanin on dubs
And they can't afford chrome so they puttin Vaseline on they hubs
I'm lookin for a girl with a ass like Trina to rub
Take home and let her watch the plasma screen in the tub
These niggas hate I move as smooth as castor cream in the club
And dont pass my green or my bub
But I'm a fly nigga that don't do much to pull her and dick her
Everyday I'm poppin a tag and pullin a sticker
Everyday I'm switchin the tags and pullin up sicker
Every ""K"" I'm loadin the mags with bullets to flicker
And I ain't hesitatin homie I'm pullin it quicker
So you can act tough After a few pulls of some liquor
Gotta pull it on niggas
And they won't be goin nowhere for a while
They might as well pull out a snicker Ye-Ye-Yea

[Hook]
Forgive me father for I have sinned
But look at all this money that I spend
And look at all this jewlery that I'm in
And look at all the places that I've been
And look at all the women in those brims
Look at the blue flames that I'm in
I look at all the bullshit that theres been
And if I had another chance I'd do it again
[Verse 2]
Anywhere the kid move you know the hammers'll be with me
Pokin out the shirt like a Pamela Lee titty
I went on tour brought the samples of D wit me
Came back a month later bought a Lambo for three-fifty
Think I throw you grams if you read with me
Just because you see me on the camera with P. Diddy
Dammit we P-driddy?? Now I got G with me
Along with the third leg that I be rammin in these bitties
I keep the revolver you hope my gun'll jam
But with the scope its gonna blam
The infra put freckles on your face like Opie Cunningham
Thats why I'm watched by the Feds and scoped by Uncle Sam
Dope and hunn-ed (hundred) grams rope and hunn-ed grams
At the same time an artist get to open Summer Jam
Hope you understand or use better sense
These niggas dont want no beef they want lawsuit settlements Nigga!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm in a waggy when I'm passin by ya
With a baby girl who suck harder than Maggie on a pacifier
What I'm smokin'll have you aggie as your last supplier
When you can smell it through the baggie you know that's some fire
Gettin stressed by these hotties is regular
I got a magazine to press to your body like editors
Test me somebody I'm beggin ya
I got the gatling gun like Jesse The Body in Predator
I'm a hustler I dont sling no rocks to the fiends now
Got dudes who sit on corners like a boxer between rounds
Any other dude who dish rocks want beef
Cause I chop dimes bigger than Chris Rock front teeth
I'm the nigga tearin the walls up in your miss in exchange for a small cup
Of the Cris
And while you at probation fillin a small cup full of piss
I'm in a coupe with a roof that ball up like a fist (Catch up!)",4,en,en,en

Ugh, Killa!
Baby!
Kanye, this that 1970s Heron flow, huh?
Yeah, let's speed it up
Ugh, I'm back in, ugh, ugh
They don't know we finna kill the game this year
Killa! 'Ye! C'mon!

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Ayo, street mergers, I legislated; the nerve, I never hated
On murders, premeditated—absurd! I hesitated
Observe: cock and spray, hit you from a block away
Drinking sake on a Suzuki; we in Osaka Bay
Playing soccer, stupid, stay in a sucker's place
Pluck your ace, take your girl, fuck her face
She dealing with Killa, so you love her taste
She swallowing Killa 'cause she love the taste
I got brought up with crooking, kitchen orders that I'm cooking
But got caught up with the juxes
You would've thought I was from Brooklyn
It gets boring just looking
Did like Bill Cosby, pouring in the pudding
Now, the dashboard is wooden from a hard-tangled grammar
Interior, inferior; Star-Spangled Banner
Car game bananas, mob manning tanners
Guns everywhere, like the car came with hammers, he's back
[Chorus: Kanye West & (Syleena Johnson)]
They trying to say he (I'm down, down)
I hear niggas saying he (I'm down, but not out)
But our flow is the truest (Oh), the game's in the nooses (No no)
Our girls is the models (Oh), they coochies the juiciest (Ooooh)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, down)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, but not out)
'Cause I'm back on my grind (Oh), money back on my mind (No no)
Ye and Killa Cam, the world is mine (Oooh)

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
I treat bitches straight up, like Simon Says
Open vagina; put your legs behind your head
Cop me Air Ones, hon, lime and red
You got pets? Me too: mines are dead, doggy
Fox, minks, gators, that's necessary
Accessories, my closet's Pet Sematary
I get approached by animal activists
I live in a zoo, I run scandals with savages
All my niggas get together to gather loot
Bodyguard for what? Dog, I'd rather shoot
I go to war, old Timbs, battered boots
Hand grenade, goggles and a parachute
Y'all don't even know the name of my flip
It was ""Touch Me, Tease Me"" when Case was the shit
You don't know bout the cases I get:
Court case, briefcase, suitcase, cases of Cris', oww!

Ye and Killa Cam, the world is mine (Oooh)

Ugh, Killa, yo, yo, ayo—
You dealing with some sure shit, my bitches pure thick
Play razor tag, slice your face, you're it!
It's I who come by, drive-thru
Gator-toed Mauri, three quarters, sky-blue
Look at mami: eyes blue, 5'2''
I approached her—""Hi, boo, how you?
Pony skin Louie? Oh, you fly too
You a stewardess? Good, ma—I fly too""
Now, a nigga got baking to bake
Harlem shake? Nah, I'm in Harlem shaking the weight
Shaking to bake, shaking the Jakes
Kill you, shoot the funeral up and Harlem Shake at your wake
Just your picture, though; you still taped in a lake
I'm laughing; you couldn't wait to escape
For anyone who owed the dough, I had to load the four
I hope a nigga heard when I said ""I told you so""
Ugh, Killa!

They call me Mr. Carter, I kissed the daughter
Of the dead's forehead, I killed the father
Spilled the heart of a mildew hater
I will put them body on chill like glaciers, gracias
I'm crazy, yes, it's obvious
Going against me is atheist
I got my angels on my shoulder and a quarter of that angel dust
I ain't sniffing, I'm just pitching, your honor
I ain't snitching, your honor
Hate bitch niggas, bitches with power
Vacate when that kitchen get hotter
I just sit on the counter
Open the cabinet, close the cupboard
Put that jar in the skillet, drop a four in the bubbles
I remember being young, tryna hustle my dope
Tryna tell the old junkies that my crack ain't soap
Tryna tell you 'fore you jump that my MAC ain't broke
You ain't tryna see how far that black back lane go, no
Call me Pac-Man, your ghost is blue
I got my Red River rubies and my ocean blue jewelry
Usually I'm a hooligan for the money
Yeah, I'm eating, but I got a tapeworm in my tummy, oh
Make harm and I bomb you in public
Hit you with the straight-arm, no warning, nothing
Look, it's morning, no yawning or nothing
I ain't sleeping, I'm up tryna take a nigga lunch
You gon' make a nigga break a nigga fronts
Then shake a nigga shorts and we taking what we want
I'm so 504, you got to kill me here
If you ever looking for me, bitch, I will be here
Cash Money is an army, Navy Seal me here
Lot of niggas ran from me, but I still be here
No chrome on the Continental, I'm so fundamental
Crack the Phil', crack the roof, and roll up the windows
And my hood love me, they tell me bring it home
That's why I holler Hollygrove on each and every song
You leaping at a dog, a dog with no bark
Just a bite like an old shark
And all you rich niggas know Pa, I'm talking 'bout Stunna

She ride my spaceship 'til she hit the top
That hit the spot
'Til she ask, ""How many li-i-li-i-licks do it take"" 'til she get to shop?
Don't worry why my wrists got so freeze
Tell a girl, ""Like Doritos, that's not 'cho cheese""
Tell her friends, ""Like Fritos, I'm tryin' to lay""
I can't only have one, and I ain't trying to wait
This a song with Wayne, so you know it's gon' melt
But you ain't finna murder me like everybody else
I'ma rap like I got some type respect for myself
I don't do it for my health, man, I do it for the belt
Man, I do it to the death, 'til the roof get melt
Hundred degrees, drop the roof, so the coupe don't melt
Man, the flow so cold, chicken soup won't help

Think it's voodoo how that roof do di-di-dissipate
Your girl want to participate
She so, so sophisticate, 'cause her brain is off the chain
And then, my diamonds are in the choir because they sing from off my chain
And my Nina just joined the gang because all she do is bang

If that woman wanna cut, then tell her I am Mr. Ointment
Tell her to make an appointment with Mr. I-Can't-Make-An-Appointment
Take my lollipop and enjoy it—remix!

Why would she? She probably be the odd cookie
In the plastic bag 'bout to get crushed by a building
I've flushed out the feeling of me being the shit
'Cause I was leaving skid marks on everywhere I sit
I am everywhere, I'm it, like Hide-and-Go
And I can go anywhere: eeny, mini, miney, mo
I'm in your neighborhood, area, CD-thing, tapedeck
​iPod, your girlfriend, and she say I got great sex
Safe sex is great sex, better wear a latex

I'm not you, Pusha

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
I keep that ziploc bustin at the stitches
Culinary chemist, I serve the malicious
To break the fiends fixes, one give you the sniffles
The other leave you with the itches
Transport airport with the Vaseline
So I can fulfill my dreams of pastures that's green
More cash then ya seen, with an Aston that's green
Me driving up fast with the lean
Zonin' family, keep youngins in them rented Camrys
Door panels full of shit and I ain't full of shit
Reckless ass, God forbid they don't crash
From the panel to the dash, it's four pounds of slab
Nah bitch, we don't believe in air bags
Cars turn tricks like them Ringling Brothers skits
Whether bitch hop out, or the Glock pop out
Ya know what I'm about, blow clear ya sinus 'til the snot drop out
[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Whoever said birds fly south for the winter's a damn lie
Got 'em right here, and if I don't like you, the grams hide
Take it or leave it, soon as a fiend taste it they need it
Make 'em smoke it right in front of you to make you believe it
Prolly think I won't murder you the way I smile
But I'ma take a lot of shots, A.I. style
And Jada, the name is filthy, but so what?
The motherfuckin game is filthy, you know what?
My mom and my pops really did a good job
But it was the Montega and the 'caine that built me
So I could never hate on another brother
God is great, the devil is a motherfucker
When you broke but they think you got money
Crackers start showin you love, your own people act funny
I tear niggas heads off, I don't discriminate
Waves, cornrows or dreads, I will eliminate

[Verse 3: Roscoe P. Coldchain]
I'm far from a noodle nigga, I stab up block reps
And turn quiet streets into hot sets
Nigga, that's funny, you say you a killer, how?
What is it, the return of the killer clowns?
Akhi, you put no fear in my heart
I make ya people say, ""Wow, that didn't look like my man""
They flipped him upside down, the coroner did what he can
He got hit with ten rounds at point blank and point blank
Coldchain left that nigga stankin
Half static and face, I got the wrinkling, slugs all in it
I had my eyes on his mink and, I didn't give em a chance to blink
When I jogged up on em, pressed the 40 up on him shocked 'em
Made his head stand on end and like a baby, I rocked 'em
The coffin the cradle, you can't bite the hand that made you
That's the beginning of the end, and you a thug that pretends
Call Coldchain ""Super Nigga,"" I got X-Ray vision, I see through men
And squeeze triggers with bullets that go through men

Fuck with S.P., that's ya date with death
Got bullets that'll break ya chest
No sleep like I hate to rest
I'm in the hood like its my fate to rep
I hold it down, any place I step
And I love getting slept on
Cause I'm rawer than dope, fresh out of Africa that never been stepped on
Dawg, I'ma clap at you the minute that you rep wrong
Holiday, the Ghost the main reason why your set gone
Why I love riffing 'em poor?
You wouldn't understand, cause my God is different than yours
If the world spin in a circle, I want to learn to move backwards
Kill niggas the first minute they jerk you
What you keep the toaster for? Creeping through the hood and
Shit ain't really good but I'm deeper than the ocean floor
Higher than a plane and meaner than a bull
I want ya insides out so I mean it when I pull

[Verse 5: Malice]
Rappers is talking to me as if (come on)
We in the same boat I tell them quick, ""No, I move coke"" (uh-uh)
And you and I don't share no common bond
So forgive me if I don't receive you with open arms (No)
It shames me to no end
To feed poison to those who could very well be my kin (uh-huh)
But where there's demand, someone will supply
So I feed them their needs, at the same time, cry
Yes, it pains me to see them need this
All of them lost souls and I'm their Jesus
Deepest regret and sympathy to the streets
I seen them pay for they fix when they kids couldn't eat (so sorry)
And with this in mind, I still didn't quit
And that's how I know that I ain't shit (I ain't shit)

Man I spit that pimp talk, you hang out where the pimps collide
It's a pimp in my ride, no need to pimp the ride
This ain't the pimp camp: pimp limp, pimp stance
Pimp-slap a slim tramp, order steak, shrimp scamp
Ok-k-kay, you g-g-gay
I'll soufflé ya toupée and bottles be a bouquet
Right where you stay, or where you stayed
That .45 trey deuce spade sprayed, you stayed
Unload the click-clack to ya fit cap
Hold the shit back, say goodbye and go commit that
For 9 years in Spain had the time share
Back to Times Square...I got dimes here
By the Port Authority, but I got more authority
Your girl she ordered Mauri, checks she forge 'em for me
Reporters report me how she report to the orgy
But it's more to the story: her daughter applaud me

Bitches might burn you; they runnin' with that clap too

Do it for those incarcerated, who had it confiscated
Hate it when they take powder

On the phone. 10 years he got, chasin' that cash
Cocaine, he had that game in a smash
Felt like the Towers when the planes went on crash

December 4th,rap,JAY-Z,2003,283714,{},"[Produced by Just Blaze]

[Intro: Gloria Carter]
Shawn Carter was born December 4th, weighing in at 10 pounds, 8 ounces. He was the last of my four children. The only one who didn't give me any pain when I gave birth to him. And that's how I knew that he was a special child.

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
They say ""They never really miss you 'til you dead or you gone.""
So on that note, I'm leavin' after this song
So you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay, so long
But at least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on
I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnis Reeves
Who made love under the sycamore tree
Which makes me a more sicker MC, and my momma would claim
At 10 pounds, when I was born, I didn't give her no pain
Although through the years I gave her her fair share
I gave her her first real scare, I made up for birth when I got here
She knows my purpose wasn't purpose; I ain't perfect, I care
But I feel worthless 'cause my shirts wasn't matchin' my gear
Now I'm just scratchin' the surface 'cause what's buried under there
Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared
I went to school, got good grades, could behave when I wanted
But I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted
Hold on
[Interlude: Gloria Carter]
Shawn was a very shy child growing up. He was into sports, and a funny story is at 4 he taught himself how to ride a bike. A two-wheeler at that, isn't that special? But I noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up.

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Now, all the teachers couldn't reach me
And my momma couldn't beat me
Hard enough to match the pain of my pop not seein' me
So, with that disdain in my membrane
Got on my pimp game; fuck the world, my defense came
Then DeHaven introduced me to the game
Spanish Jose introduced me to 'caine, I'm a hustler now
My gear is in and I'm in the in-crowd
And all the wavy light-skinned girls is lovin' me now
My self-esteem went through the roof, man, I got my swag
Got a Volvo from this girl when her man got bagged
Plus I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had
Supposedly, knowin' nobody paid Jaz wack-ass
I'm gettin' ahead of myself; by the way, I could rap
But that came second to me movin' this crack
""Gimme a second, I swear,"" I would say about my rap career
'Til '96 came, niggas, I'm here; goodbye!

[Interlude: Gloria Carter]
Shawn used to be in the kitchen, beating on the table and rapping until the wee hours of the morning. And then I bought him a boom box, and his sisters and brothers said he would drive them nuts. But that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble.

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Goodbye to the game, all the spoils, the adrenaline rush
Your blood boils you in the spot, knowin' cops could rush
And you in a drop, you're so easy to touch
No two days are alike except the first and fifteenth, pretty much
And ""trust"" is a word you seldom hear from us
Hustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye up
And the drought will define a man when the well dries up
You learn the worth of water without work
You thirst 'til you die, yup!
And niggas get tied up for product
And little brothers' ring fingers get cut up
To show mothers they really got 'em
And this was the stress I lived with
'Til I decided to try this rap shit for a livin', I pray I'm forgiven
For every bad decision I made, every sister I played
‘Cause I'm still paranoid to this day
And it's nobody fault, I made the decisions I made
This is the life I chose, or rather, the life that chose me
[Outro: JAY-Z]
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
Now if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade...",15,en,en,en

With both hands on her tits
Corleone hold the throne, that you know in your heart

A while back, I used to hustle, selling blow in the park
Counting G stacks and rocking ice that glow in the dark

I fuck around and throw three in your chest and flee to my rest

You on some tag-along, flunky yes-man shit
Do me a favor; please get off the next man dick
And if you think I can't fuck with whoever, put your money up
Put your jewels up, no, fuck it, put your honey up
Put your raggedy house up, nigga, or shut your mouth up
Before I buck lead and make a lot of blood shed
Turn your tux red, I'm far from broke, got enough bread
And mad hoes, ask Beavis, I get nothing Butthead
My game is vicious and cruel, fucking chicks is a rule
If my girl think I'm loyal, then that bitch is a fool
How come? You can listen to my first album
And tell where a lot of niggas got they whole style from
So what you acting for?
You ain't half as raw, you need to practice more
Somebody tell this nigga something, 'fore I crack his jaw
You running with boys, I'm running with men
I'mma be ripping the mics until I'm a hundred and ten
Have y'all niggas like ""Dammit, this nigga done done it again""
I throw slugs at idiots, no love for city cops
I sport a pretty watch, eight-hundred and fifty rocks
I'm making wonderful figures
I don't fuck with none of you niggas
I might pull out this gun on your niggas
And rob every last one of you niggas
[Verse 2]
Aight, let me kick some more shit, one more time
(Yeah-yeah… Spit, some more) - Bobbito
Aight, check it out, yeah, check it out
Yeah, check it out, yeah, check it out
Uhh, check it out, aight, check it out
Aight, we gone hit it like this, check it out
Yo, check it, yo, my shit is hot like jerk chicken
I should rob you, but with that cheap shit, you ain’t worth stickin'
I’ve got a left hook that be leaving guys knocked out
Keep fronting and I'mma choke you till your eyes pop out
I was taught that if a nigga swing, swing right back
Battle Corleone, why do a stupid thing like that?
Yo, I’m not in the mood, son, so don’t push me tonight
Plus I fucked your little sister and that pussy was right
That pussy was tight — gripping my dick like a pair of pliers
You fucking snitch; right now you prolly wearing wires
It’s not a joke, so as soon as he laugh
I’mma strip him naked and stick a long broom in his ass
Leave him heart-broken, make him quit rap and start smoking
My album is done, so no, there ain't no parts open
I’m not a sweet stud, I’m a street thug
That’s quick to beat a nigga like a cheap rug till he leak blood
You sure soft, watched you fall off, might slide your whore off
Then call all off, and tear your jaw off
My life is far out, I got star clout
Every week, bring a different car out
Go to clubs and buy the bar out
You ain’t a player, put that cigar out
Take that suit off, before I shoot off, and tear your roof off
Leave your clothes bloody-red like the nose of Rudolph
I rocked many stages and never got booed off
I might let this gat burst, put you in a big black hearse
For that wack verse, should have tried these other cats first
'Cause none of y'all niggas can fuck with me
And if your man wanna join, I got McGruff with me
We puff much izzy
I do shit that only tough men do
And them cats you with—fuck them too, I’ll buck them too
Be careful what you rush into, you lame-ass nigga
No dough, always on the train-ass nigga
Canal Street, 10-karat-chain-ass nigga
You got fucked upstate, you cupcake
How many dicks can your butt take?
I ran through every bitch in my path
I was fucking chicks in the ass when I was six-and-a-half
Yo, I’mma take you out your misery
And after this, nigga
Put you in the social study book 'cause you’re history",16,en,en,en

He was talking shit, we put a clap into that boy (Yeah)
[Verse 1: Malice]
I heard they snitching on a player; man, say it ain't so
Even as a young'un', they consigned me to blow
Which explains why I'm worth my weight in gold
While they was taking baby steps from an eighth to an O
Word in the streets that the envy is me
Enough ice on that watch to make a nigga lose sleep
Magnified face help the bitch see clearly
Nine on the waist, hit the bitch up severely
I'm known for the flip of that cocaína
I'm heavy in the street like the 7-Serie' Beemer, man
Hit 'em with the Nina, man
Or that four-fit', guaranteed to lean your man, whoa!
I'm the reason that your block is vacant
Malicious will hit you just to make a statement, bitch
Clipse and Cash Money—who ain't rich?
Don't compare me to you, nigga; you ain't this, whoa!

Stunna and Patty Cake, the worldwide pusher (Let's get this money, nigga! Let's get this money!)
Birdman, nigga, leave the guns in the bushes
Been shitting up bricks, unload 'em to Gussy (Cuff 'em up, light 'em up, bitch)
Boss of the ghetto with the round-shape cookie
Shit one, throw one, nigga, flood the block
If I don't go to jail, nigga, birds gon' flock (Brrr! Brrr!)
Nigga sitting on the toilet, bitch, get off the pot!
The bird just landed so the hood gonna rock
New whips, big chips, the Prada-Gucci shit
Bought mami a fly Benz, the wide, skinny lips
She takes my flight, she holds my weight
While the Port was staked out from state to state
It ain't nothing to a baller, baby
Pay the cost, big money, heavyweight, Birdman, hood boss, baby
Stepping on my line, I'll show a little something
Make Corleone come out and the black crow'll touch you

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Ugh! Another soul lost
Had to make his shirt match my oxblood-colored Porsche
Ugh! The rims match, of course
Blood hit his Timbs, it reminded me of them
Glistening, wrist on chiller
Gun in the same palm, a gorgeous killer
I put this on my Lord:
My niece was four when she felt chinchilla
I passed the chauffeur that shit
That made fiends rise from the dead like ""Thriller""
Gangster, hustler
At night, still found time to kiss my mother
Live like I'm dreaming, kick my feet up
Gun poked my waist, remind me of my demon, so
Quit your yappin' before I get to clappin'
And have your body parts mix-and-matchin', fella

Yo, show closer, J-to-the-A-Y-Hovah

Game spitter, Range sitter, Bentley driver nigga
Keep a full clip, I have to empty out on niggas
Ho bagger, no slacker, get this shit jumping
Like eight blacks, four crackers, get your ass jumped
Cris' sipper, six dipper, wrist glitter nigga
Gat buster, ass toucher.. clit licker
Go against Jigga your ass is dense
I'm about a dollar, what the fuck is 50 Cents?
Hot shit, kick a nigga, turn these mics out
My jewelry so bright you can turn these lights out
Hova's like Noah keep two in the truck
I'm like U-Haul; every bitch moving I fuck
You move slut, I gotta put two in your butt
I'm everything: the when's, why's, who's, and what

Give my ladies dick, my young hoes pee-pee
Hits in a row like MJ; ""Hee-hee!""
Since I was waist height, late night, busting in the clouds
Running wild, coming home late, cussing out my mouth
Niggas said, ""Bryan leave your cousin in the house""
Every time we play the Dozen, he's bugging out
While y'all was playing yo-yo, I was sitting on low pros
Dipping the po-po, getting that dough-dough
No, no I ain't stupid I take loot kid
What's in the bank? Shoot it
Lose it like I ain't do it
You wanna play Jigga, nigga? What you drank, fluid?
Got a full tank, now you wanna pull rank?
I clap steel, act ill, Jigga shoot thee
Give you chest pains, leg sprains—absolutely! What!

Try to play hard get you found 'round the dirt
Six shell casings found round your shirt

Six shots, hit the pole, hit the van up
Kidnap grown folks get them grands up

Losing Weight Pt. 2,rap,Cam'ron,2002,32712,"{""Cam\\'ron"",""Juelz Santana""}","[Chorus: Cam'ron]
Ayo, fuck losing weight
I'm back on these highways moving cakes
Life's based upon what I'ma do today
Cop a car, new estate
Nah, fuck it get the beef and brocs: blue and gray
Baby due today
I got to move an eighth
Fuck the scrutiny
Y'all niggas screwing me
Killa never let the drama slide
Y'all gon' hear a nigga momma die
Yell out ""homicide""

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Yo, 18 months? Please, that ain't facing time
I'm stressed anyway, need it for vacation time
I'ma do the right thing though, take shock anyway
6 months, right back on the damn block anyway
But look, money from across the street
Think it's sweet, think he get money across the street
Me and my peeps often meet
And 5-0 they work for us, walk the beat
Walk with heat 'cause talk is cheap
So dun stay silent
Revolvers, automatics, guns stay silent
When it comes to beef it becomes a talent
Remember me, ODB, I'm the one from Violence, Killa
Digital ten, shit get critical friend
I got 800 invisible men
That mean it could be the bank-man
Person at the gas station filling up your tank, fam
Lady at the frank stand'll
Rat poison your relish right in the center, babe
Bitch is a renegade, she'll piss in your lemonade!
And y'all dead now
That you can bet now
Do like a toaster put your bread down
Upset now, hate when I gotta rep, clowns, blow TEC rounds
In a collision, I see their ambition
But they don't know them days I was stooped up and pitching
Or all them hot summers I was cooped up in the kitchen
When it came to grams it was 90 I fried
350 on the stove and it's 90 outside
I'ma get this girl that be stuffing my bricks
Felt life cheated her, she be cutting her wrists
Her mom died, her-on overdose stuffed in her wrist
Father fucking her, older man fucking her sis
But love my music, say I do nothing but hits
She'll do anything for me, nothing but hits
'Cause when she needed help I got her nothing but fixed
Needed coke, needed dope, yeah, I gave her a fix
So she went across the street, gave him a kiss
Stuck her tongue out, flirted, played with his dick
""You know Cam?"" He said, ""yeah"", ""Don't play with his chips""
Stood back, blazed him with 6, amazing and shit
Huh, Killa, Killa, Dipset nigga
[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
Yo, fuck losing weight
We back on these highways moving cakes
Life's based upon what I'ma do today
Take my moms, move away
Yeah, I think I'ma cop me that new estate
Baby due today
I got to move an eighth
Fuck the scrutiny

Juelz never let the cops get me
On the block 'til the shots hit me
Until the shots get me

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Niggas wanna know why I'm so nice
When it comes to spitting that fire, it's real dog, I live in the fire
Used to being in the streets homie, in the midst of the fire
Break work, put it in pots, sit it in fire
Quick to grab the fifth and just fire
Try to peel off, I'm hitting your tires
Hittin' your door while your car's spinning, hitting the wall
That's just the beginning of war
I let you know you dealing with dogs
My villains'll finish you off
Head in your chest, brain-
Dead on the Van Wyck expressway
While I got my hand in the TEC, wave
Niggas like ""fuck, is he stupid?"" (Yes I am)
Cops wanna cuff me, do it
You wanna be a hero, snuff me, do it, rush me, do it
Shit, like I ain't been through the scars and bruises
Like I ain't been through the bars, seen the sergeant troopers
Look at my body, I lost so much weight
Cops raiding my spot, I done lost so much weight
I'm telling Papi ""front me a brick, let me owe that cake""
He telling me he ain't got but so much weight
He been waiting for his connection to come
I'm like ""at least give me a half, I'll compress it and stretch it to one""
I'm on the block as usual
With that block that you chop and the rocks as usual
Watching for the cops that's moving through
Me and my soldiers know the rules to use ‘case we get bopped by the dudes in blue
We use cakes to get by, by the dudes in blue
Keep your mouth locked, screwed and glued
Or shots from the Ruger duke'll circle round your body like hula-hoops (woo!)
Mami told me son, hold your own
And one day you gon' grow to be a rolling stone
I believed her...
Juelz never let the cops get me
On the block 'til the shots hit me...

Sold crack to those who couldn't take the pain
And had to numb it with base
Couldn't drink the Henny straight, I needed somethin to chase
Nowadays I throw shots back, leavin' nothin' to waste
Life's like a treadmill, niggas runnin' in place
Gettin' nowhere fast, a whole year done past
I vowed to never stop winnin', 'til the earth stop spinnin'
Rock hot linen, cop hot cars and hot women
If it's not him then you got it confused, y'all not rememberin'
My motto is, simply ""I will not lose!""
Abide by the block rules, I buy my Glocks used
With bodies on it, let me know anybody want it?
I'm raised, irrational, ways misunderstood
If you ain't live like I live, then one with the hood
I done what I could, to come up with this paper 'til this day still
Run with the hood, guess it's part of my nature
If hell awaits a, nigga I'm comin' with the razors
Still flashin' ya shit, try to pass me in a six
Type classy on the wrist, every bit of 30 karats

May these words find a spot on your brain and burn
Then I recycle my life, I shall return

Yo, yo Drew and Inf
This-this, this right here is crazy
Yo I, I feel big, you know what I mean?
Like, not, not big in the sense of, weight
You know what I mean? Like gainin' weight or nothin' like that
Like colossal
Like, you know what I mean, like (sighs)
I heard you were lookin' for me

[Chorus: Sha-Ron Prescott & Lil Wayne]
Hey, Mr. Carter (Hello)
Tell me, where have you been? (Haha, you know, hehe)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (I know, haha)
Hey, Mr. Carter (Hey, hello)
Tell me, where have you been? (Shit, you know)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (Hahahah)
[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, to you forever, from me to you
I heard somebody say ""Church!"" I'ma need a suit
I'ma need a coupe, I won't need a roof
Flyer than Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice
I got the flow, I'm tryin' to see the roof
Didn't wear a bulletproof so I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do?
But I'ma leave it to God, not Beaver, neither you
Cause I'ma murder Y, kill O, and even U
Man, I got summer hatin' on me cause I'm hotter than the sun
Got spring hatin' on me 'cause I ain't never sprung
Winter hatin' on me 'cause I'm colder than y'all
And I will never, I will never, I will never fall
I'm being hated by the seasons
So fuck y'all who hatin' for no reason

[Chorus: Sha-Ron Prescott & Lil Wayne]
Hey, Mr. Carter (I am him!)

Yeah, I been in and out the bank, bitch
While y'all asshole niggas been on the same shit
I flush and watch 'em go down the drain quick
Two words you never hear: ""Wayne quit!?""
Cause Wayne win, and they lose
I call 'em April babies, cause they fools
And when they snooze, we up!
Feet up, like a paraplegia
Or paraplegic? I parallel park
In that red-and-yellow thing; old school Atlanta Hawk
Like I'm from College Park, but I'm from Hollygrove
Now all my Bloods scream ""Soo-woo"" and ""Da-da-doe""
I know my role and I play it well
And I weigh it well, on my Libra scale
I suck a pussy, fuck a pussy, leave it there
Long hair, don't even care

Hey, Mr. Carter (Young! I am him)

I'm right here in my chair with my crown and my dear
Queen B, as I share, mic time with my heir
Young Carter, go farther, go further, go harder
Is that not why we came? And if not, then why bother?
Show no mercy in Murcielagos
I'm far from bein' the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my name's been mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggies and the Pacs and the Marleys and the Marcuses
Garvey; got me a molotov-cocktail flow
Even if you box well, can't stop the blows
Kaboom! The Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy I just came off the spoon
Also, I'm so fly I'm on auto-
Pilot, while guys just stare at my wardrobe
I see Euros, that's right: plural
I took so much change from this rap game, it's your go
(Hey Mr. Carter) Young!

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
It's my go, yeah… And I'ma go so opposite of soft
Off the richter, Hector, Camacho Man, Randy Savage
Far from average, above status–quo, flow so pro
I know, I ride slow, and when I pass
They say, ""What up, killa?"" Man, stop bringin' up my past
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie, or Jay-Z
Don't forget Weezy, Baby!

Hey, Mr. Carter (Amen)
Tell me, where have you been? (Yeah)

And I swear to everything, when I leave this Earth
It's gonna be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
And you can try me, fucker, but when I squeeze, it hurt
Fine, we'll lose two lives; yours and mine

At the funeral parlor, drippin' tears down my sleeve

The Liberation of Lonzo Williams,rap,The Coup,1993,851,{},"[Verse 1 - Boots Riley (and E-Roc)]
1986 a motherfucker doing tricks in the mix and I don't mean the fader
Face of zits but getting grits with black steel firesticks
Trying to build an Empire something like Darth Vader
Now Lonzo was armed with nothing but a mean mug
(But tucked a forty-five, with forty-five slugs)
He was a jitterbug thug, at the dance, cuttin a rug
(Treatin his sisters like a hooker) Greetin his partners with a hug
Breakdown shakedown, this brother would take pounds
Of soon to be cake grounds, and then go make rounds
Firearms protected wads of gorgeous green
Paper stacks of paid tax off of broken dreams
At puberty his liberty was found within a ki
Rocks were cookin but he's lookin for a way to be free
Here's a ki (there's a ki) but Lonzo, where's yours?
There's no key to the door, but there's money on the floor
(So stoop down) bend over (hurry pick it up fast)
But watch out, Lonzo -- YOU'LL GET FUCKED IN THE ASS

[HOOK]
[Verse 2 - Boots Riley (and E-roc)]
Knock knock (who is it?) time to visit but it's two years late
Cause Lonzo's rollin harder and it's 1988
He's got some fat ends, got some more friends, (and a brand new Benz)
He's got respect and he suspects that it won't end
A couch is still a couch (and a chair is still a chair)
But a house is now a crackhouse, Luther, Lonzo's there
Dying brains, dying bodies, taken from these dead residence
Trying in vain to kill their pain, exchanging dead presidents
Many bourgeoise parlez francoise (I don't speak it but I know it)
It's all the same (the business game) but you go to jail for this shit
We were tribal our survival was now based on stoppin rivals
Who's the fittest, as I raise my fists, I can't survive and not be ruthless
(So while we scrape, and scratch for bones
And a cellular phone, somebody's sittin on the throne
Cause they don't let, black folks own)
THEY JUST GIVE US THIS SHIT ON LOAN, KICK IT

[HOOK]

(Ahaha, yeah, what was I fidna say?
Aww yeah Lonzo's back in the County, man)
Damn we'll go visit him on Sunday when we visit Dee, aight?

[Verse 3 - Boots Riley (and E-roc)]
(Madge says that Bounty is the quicker-picker-upper)
Well Lonzo says the County is the slip-up, trip-up, stuck-up
Years of unsettled funk and who gets what bunk junk
Makes you feel like you took a test and flunked
(But don't get disturbed or perturbed; the teacher's
On my last nerve, plus he grades with a downhill curve)
Told Lonzo kick it, the system is wicked, trick it, but dig it
We got a way to lick it, gave him a book, said, ""Here's the ticket""
(Now he's addicted) to learnin how we been afflicted
And what distributin that shit did
I made a quick bid to say, ""Don't trip kid
You never worked for the mob"" (You had a government job)
Lonzo knew I was right, no fight, now we're tight
(Plus he been out of jail about a year ago last night)
Now he hangs with us for revolutionary ruckus
And five-oh, more than ever wants to fuck us
Just cause we know the road to riches is crooked and narrow
We'll get more power from a hundred thousand gun barrels",646,en,en,en

Got ya' hangin’ on the edge of your seat, get on down

Time’s up, game’s over, you lose, I win
’Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Oh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who’s got you goin’ crazy again
I’m a trend, I set one every time I’m in
I go out, and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you something that we already had
But once you’re gone, you don’t come back (Oh!)
Too bad, you’re off the map now, radar can’t even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around, just playin’ the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin’ and moanin’, whining and bitchin’
Sit and observe, listen, you’ll learn if you pay attention

I don’t gotta' promote it, for you to know that Doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin’ off the hinges
We ain’t showin’ off, we just going off popular consensus
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off, who the fuck is Doc impressin’?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, ’cause Doc left you all guessin’
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (What?!)
We gon’ have this motherfucker hoppin’ in a second (Bump, bump!)
That’s why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
’Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn’t for rap to bridge the gap may be raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Graced the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the caped crusaders and leave it to me and Dre
To pass the mic and we can play the
Back and forth all day like the hot potato game
That’s why we came to…

And plenty honey’s involved and sunny Sundays and palm trees

From the valleys all the way to them 8 Mile alleys

Now raise up out your seat, Dre’s about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week

Provide you with the heat that keep blazing out your speakers

Imagine that a few years back I was bagging cracks
Magnum gats playing street corners, committing savage acts

We all are falling when we think we all are rising
We pop Cris' on the horizon, topless chicks with thick thighs and
I rather be civilizing, enterprising, improvising
Temperature rising, Elohim gave me the guidance
Told me, ""Leave those 85ers alone, blend with the wise men""
That bought 80 G stones, twin Mercedes on homes
Fuck it, just spend 10 G alone on chrome
When I die they'll take my chromosomes and clone clones

See many never complete they cycle
Other retreat to bibles, living holy
But currency seem to control me, moving coldly
In the presence of old parolies
My mind mold me, keep me in mack mode like Goldie
Police know me, but ain't got enough to hold me
I follow rules, through the knowledge, swallow jewels
A form of teaching, from the streets never taught in school
You caught you lose, a wise man utilize tools
Solitude certifies all moves
So I walk this path of the old dread, that lead me off the Ave
Absorbing fast, learning from niggas I lost in the past
Its poison plays in these foul days
Housing cops and they foul ways, I'm walking through a wild maze
Holding my brain trying to maintain
Sleet hell, snow, or rain, I guess the game will never change

Since the genesis, paraphernalia circle my premises
Poor images, project life drained my innocence
It's all the worst genocide, I guess the water's cursed

She prayed for peace, hoping I'm saved before she lay deceased
To say the least, the one to wise to play the streets
I know the ropes, certain niggas to slow to cope
& though I sold some Coke, it was only to stay afloat
Amongst the frozen hearted, some bending, some departed
Inhaling chocolate, tracing back to where it started
The Crack wave 2 for 5, deuce and trays
The Mack sprays, puffin' lye, truth & days
& though it sound ill, through all the foul shit, I'm down still
All around real, rough is the grounds in Brownsville
I know the ledge, meditating, holding my head
Eyes red, it's ""Doe or Die"" till I'm dead

I played all positions, plus learned from each mission
Politic wit all type niggas wit different diction
I did it up, from young in some cunt, the way I hit it up
Bugging off my first Philly Blunt, and how I lit it up
But time flying, playing these corners I'll let it slide by
Smoking lye, homicide, coke supplies dry
So play the game, other slow up change the lane
Awaken, unchain the brain in exchange to take away the pain
It's a part of scriptures, put together wit different mixtures
They tricked us, got us trapped in taking pictures
Interrogating, locating, destination, estimating
Or play a part of them investigating
It's on going from them killers, to them broads hoeing
Unknowing first time felons on trial blowing
So burn your clips and sit back, learn your shit

Previously cocked, tucked in my shirt for every session
But hold up, a 2-6 bid made me grow up

We'd often sip quarts, they get tossed at the spit line
To all niggas that the Lord seemed to gip for their time
While we plan to live forev', he had a different design
Is it safe to say, we all perish on the sacred day?

Yo, wake up to the world, stay in charge of your dreams
Keep your vision, focus, get wise, enlargen your cream
Marketin' schemes, so many in the dark is unseen
Caught in between, perhaps rap was a fortunate thing
Forced to be king from hustlin', supportin' them fiends
Bustin' guns, I had no remorse as a teen
Rockin' birth stones, my first skid bid, nurse the dome
It hurts to zone, now I've realized, I'm on this Earth alone
Time ticks, devilish mind design tricks
Leave you blind quick and cause you to die behind shit
Mathematics, master 120, I'm Asiatic
Amazed with magic 'cause it's illusions that made me savage
Life change once you establish the right game

No doubt, time to mellow out, party at the yellow house
Yell it out, invites only, don't tell no slouch
How you feel around some made cats, really on chill
Laid back with the Alizé, millis concealed
Conversating like some more pimps caught in the mix
Wasn't taught shit, stressed out, supporting your bitch
Let the ice shine, easing my mind with white wine
Assured lifeline, squeezing my nine the right time
Camouflage life, feds almost bagged the god twice
Bizarre nights, move on the grace of Allah's light
All Armani white, feeling like Christ with the army type
Cons be writing, knowing my life is based upon the hype
Burning incense with intents to school the infants
The rules are different, so for those that choose to listen
It's a dice game, never know, plans might change
Stay in your price range, far from the stress of night pains

I guess Bacardi Lime gave me my strength to go the extra nine
Next in line, slow G-ing, low-keying
Me and the crew in the gold BM ODing
Top speed, blowing through the sweet night breeze
Wherever life leads, anything's better besides a tight squeeze
Sliced cheese, even my pieces pushing nice Vs
Dressed precisely, hoping soon one be the wifey
It's working well, process words, helping to purge and sell
Urban hell, playing park benches, burning Ls
It's all basics, probation, open cases
We ill-natured, being trained young from hatred
Trapped in the arms of Satan, congregating
Conversating, trying to map ways of escaping
It's truth or dare, only the chosen move sincere
Keep the youth aware, pass on jewels as souvenirs

Attract women, low fade, waves laid and spinning
Stay paid four different ways, put my bid in
No sleep, be playing with time, my mind goes deep
These cold streets, rock a diamond chip, gold teeth
Trying to stay sane amongst the madness and maintain
Though the game changed, the message involved remained plain
Poor advice given, we all strive for nice living

Which failed; I went to jail at the age of fifteen

Tryin' to get a clutch at what I could not—
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin', goin' upstate's my destination
Handcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turned, I learned life is hell
Livin' in the world no different from a cell
Every day I escape from Jakes givin' chase
Sellin' base, smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask: what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the old Earth
Who explained workin' hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stick-up kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks
And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth

See who's this pagin' me and why
It's my nigga, Pop from the barbershop
Told me he was in the gambling spot and heard the intricate plot
Of niggas wanna stick me like flypaper, neighbor
Slow down, love, please chill, drop the caper
Remember them niggas from the hill up in Brownsville
That you rolled dice with, smoked blunts and got nice with?
Yeah, my nigga Fame up in Prospect
Nah, them my niggas, nah, love, wouldn't disrespect
I didn't say them
They schooled me to some niggas that you knew from back when
When you was clockin' minor figures
Now they heard you're blowin' up like nitro
And they wanna stick the knife through your windpipe slow
So, thank Fame for warnin' me, 'cause now I'm warnin' you
I got the MAC, nigga, tell me what you gonna do
[Chorus]
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G. & Pop]
They heard about the Rolexes and the Lexus
With the Texas license plates out of state
They heard about the pounds you got down in Georgetown
And they heard you got half of Virginia locked down
They even heard about the crib
You bought your moms out in Florida, the Fifth Corridor
Call the coroner!
There's gonna be a lot of slow singin' and flower-bringin'
If my burglar alarm starts ringin'
What ya think all the guns is for?
All-purpose war, got the Rottweilers by the door
And I feed 'em gunpowder so they can devour
The criminals tryin' to drop my decimals
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my cream
And it ain't a dream, things ain't always what it seem
It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see your picture
Now they wanna grab they guns and come and get ya
Bet ya Biggie won't slip
I got the Calico with the black talons loaded in the clip
So I can rip through the ligaments
Put the fuckers in a bad predicament
Where all the foul niggas went
Touch my cheddar, feel my Beretta
Buck what I'ma hit you with, you motherfuckers better duck
I bring pain, bloodstains on what remains
Of his jacket, he had a gun, he shoulda packed it
Cocked it, extra clips in my pocket
So I can reload and explode on your asshole
I fuck around and get hardcore
C-4 to your door, no beef no more, nigga
Feel the rough, scandalous
The more weed smoke I puff, the more dangerous
I don't give a fuck about you or your weak crew
What you gonna do when Big Poppa come for you?
I'm not runnin', nigga, I bust my gun and
Hold on, I hear somebody comin'
[Skit]
C'mon, motherfucker
Man, I'm comin' as fast as I can
Just g— bring your motherfuckin' ass on, come on
Are we gettin' close, huh?
It's right over here
You sure it's Biggie Smalls crib, man?
Yeah, I'm sure, motherfucker, come on
Man, fuck, this better be his motherfuckin' house
Fuck, right here

- Alright, well I'm with you, gimmie your number
- No doubt, no doubt
- Here go my number right here
[Verse 1]
You know the happenings, homies just yappin' and
Hand shaking, laughing, and exchangin' all they math again
You usually lose touch when you travelin'
A few dudes bruised up in the battlin'
Parked on Madison across from the Radisson
We talked about the tattlin' some niggas did in Maryland
Plus discussed old homicides unravelin'
I asked, was he dabblin', he laughed and said he managin'
His Carti frames was as clear as a camera lens
He hardly changed, I was near in comparison
We joked about how police choked him out
And he claimed as far as fame I had enough to bust in Oprah's mouth
In other words, I was up in clout
And from the curb I need to pull a Larry Bird, 'fore I'm up and out
Without a sound, snatched my Guinness off the ground
Rose up, gave him a pound and told him, ""Homie, hold it down""

[Hook]
You know the game insane in the brain
Big things in the Range, real niggas never change
And though we homies and we no longer hang
You know you know me and that love still remains
So through the fame, through the fire and the flames
I adapt to the pain, real niggas do the same
And though we homies and we no longer hang
You know you know me and that love still remains
[Verse 2]
It was Tuesday when I saw him, figured Friday I could call him
Woke up early Wednesday morning, flew a chick in from New Orleans
She ain't that average bitch who be doggin' for dick
You know them chicks that get you sick when they keep callin'
Up in Nordstrom's for a fresh pair to floss 'em
Of course with footwear I be that first nigga that sport 'em
Caught 'em before the salesmen even had time to assort 'em
Bought 'em before any celeb stylist ever saw 'em
Wore 'em soon as I copped 'em in the spot playing possum
Debating my destination, lacing, weighing my options
Celly started rockin', I answered, what's poppin'
They answered and said, they shot him, now the hood got a problem
I had to swallow, reaching out for my water bottle
Tryin' to figure what nigga, why and by who, then
Before you know it, the other voice told it
It was homie from the old clique I just seen and spoke with

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It's Doe or Die, we survive 'till we slain
And it's no surprise, homie was probably high when they came
I know the guy, he was fly, him and I was the same
A Gemini, with a status symbolized as his name
Godly trained, he could camouflage on any terrain
Carti frames, we go back like Bartles and James
It's a shame cause they say his baby mom is to blame
But nonchalantly I refrained cause it constantly changed
From close range, somebody please slowly explain
If they just wanted some jewels why didn't they go for the chain
If they just wanted some news they could've left him in his Hanes
But no, they just left a nigga breathless and banged

And all my ghetto bitches in the projects
Comin' through like bulldozers
No, we ain't sober
Bum bitches know better than to start shit
Niggas love a hard bitch
One that get up in a nigga's ass quicker than an enema
Make a cat bleed then sprinkle it with vinegar
Kidnap the senator
Make him call his wife and say he never comin' home
Kim got 'em in the zone, beatin' they dicks
Even got some of these straight chicks rubbin' their tits
What? I'm lovin' this shit, Queen Bitch!
What bitch you know can thug it like this?
Imagine if I was dude and hittin' cats from the back
With no strings attached, yeah nigga, picture that
I treat y'all niggas like y'all treat us, no doubt
Ay yo, yo, yo, come here so I can bust in ya mouth

Count a million bucks in the back of an armor truck
While I get you fucked up off the T.O.N.Y

(On and on and on) like Erykah Badu
Once he drink the Remy down, ooh, I got this nigga now
He asked me did I love him I said what came to mind
Like niggas be doin': ""Yeah baby, I love you long time""
Look I ain't tryin' to suck ya, I might not even fuck ya
Just lay me on this bed and give me some head
Got the camcord layin' in the drawer where he can't see
Can't wait to show my girls he sucked the piss out my pussy
Been doin' this for years, no need to practice
Take lessons from the Queen and you'll know how to mack this
Niggas know he gave me all his cake
I peeled the Benji's off and threw the singles back in his face

I'm tryna see my face on a hunnid dolla bill
Met this dude name Jaleel at this Abdulla fight
He said he'd pay me ten grand just to belly dance
Cum all on his pants
I met him at the studio
He showed up with his homeboy named Julio
I said ""Whoa! Who's the other guy?
Hope you know you payin' extra for this fuckin' third eye""
Something about him, I knew he was a phony
Put the burner in his mouth: ""Fool, Give me my money!""
He was just a nigga frontin' like he knew mad stars
In his homeboy's whips like he got mad cars

You don't wanna tango, I'll dress you in a halo
Cock the gauge, polka dot your braids
Face you with a chrome 4 that'll lock your legs
And you can't move, I roll big and I can't lose
They watch so hard, ain't nothing I do that ain't news
Carry it like I'm a stranger to the game
I cut short any whisper that endanger my name
I hold toasts on both coasts, not for no joke
I'm known in the streets on the account I know coke
And we got word that the cops watch us
But that don't stop us, we maneuver and move a little more cautious
I hate to think that the dope game is my callin'
Cause it got us singing lullabies to our fallen:
""Good night friend, 'til we meet again
But for now in your name, we re-up and eat again""
Uh, I never front like I'm something I'm not
But being broke, well that's just something I'm not
Y'all talk with hatred, but I live off that
And I lived off cocaine way 'fore I lived off rap
Feel me, friend, if they could, they'd kill me, friend
Cause I weigh too much, learned not to say too much
They couldn't take me in the CL, that's way too much
And I'm too gone, y'all niggas can talk on

They call me Mr. Please-Believe-It, believe it please
I put the pump in your mouth and help you breath with ease

Y'all the type of players that be getting two-day contracts
E-mail snitch got Ds in your two-way contacts
I'm in the club sippin' on that new 'Ze cognac
In the number 9 Jordans with the deuce trey on back
The Street Family so cool, we could pull bitches
Even if it was July and we had on Woolrich's
I got them teflons, to shove in the 4
That have undercovers and po', recovering slow
The government know, the kid been loving the dough
Since I was moving white off the curb like shoveling snow

I keep the streets so numb they call me ""Novocaine""
I turn over 'caine, over and over again
Hell, so much clientele
I could lose it all today, be back the next day
Still up in the same way
As I left ya, all in three gestures: down, up and aim
I can define death better than Webster, wet ya
Now bless ya, and off to my next venture
Blocks so white, June look like December
Wintertime: snow everywhere, flow everywhere
So much dough, I fly my hoes everywhere
Ask him, Pusha T, Pusha-Ton
Push a ton of that shit that makes ya nose run
Yes I'm holding, whether it's heat or coke in
In the door panel of my four-wheel motion
Ain't jokin', but I laugh how other flows convince you
It's money, it's funny, it's Comedy Central

Hovered and govern the corner you hugged then I shuffle you roadie

Don't worry about mine, I'ma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit

Yeah, the sky is the limit
And if you look high, you'll see that I'm gon' be in it
'Cause the sky is the limit
They tell me, ""Don't get high"" and I should try to make a living
I tell 'em I'm a hustler, and I'd rather make a killing

Killa! (Killa!), Dipset, man
Ayo you know I've been all over the motherfucking world, man
But ain't no place like Harlem, man
Let me break it down, man

[Verse 1]
We tie dynamite to the rhino type, wino might find yo' sight
Sell the information for a dime of white, that China-China
I'm behind the diner, selling marijuana to a minor-miner
Elder fella; looking for that shine? I'll shine ya
My mind designer. You a dime? I'll dine ya
Madonna momma, body bottled, you're fine. I'm finer
Time to climb her, climb behind vagina
Then I hymen-grind her 'til her mom remind her
Diamonds blind her; vision's gone, kiss her palm
Turn her arm, lift her arm, notice that her wrists is raw
""Gotta get it right ma, we gon' get along""
Said ""how?"" ""don't trip,"" but, yo, the trick is wrong
First visi-on, day job tick-a-tron
Nighttime, Mr. Mom, bootleg Cris' and Dom
Brother Chris and Don, and their sister Carm
They sell yay', you'll say ""yay, this shit's the bomb""
I'ma hit my man, tell 'em you my pick upon
The rest, so yes, you'll be blessed to hit the intercom
You know, kiss his mom, she gave him wisdom charm
And their father come from a long list of dons
And I get it cheaper, I cop bricks like sneakers
And if the cops come, I just hit amnesia
But I give you an earful, it's tearful
Told my mother I hustle and she said ""be careful""
[Chorus]
Why I feel like I'm losing weight?
Why I ain't got no money if I'm moving weight?
My life's based upon what I'ma do this year
Cop a boat, cop a Lear
Now the army suit's cute with my chocolate Airs
You ain't gotta stare, go cop a pair
Still the scrutiny, nothing they can do to me
I made sure my mother and girl is smothered in pearls
When a nigga under the world (Killa!)

[Verse 2]
Everybody like, ""Cam got the recipe now!""
Not them 3 girls, I got to be Destiny's Child (gotta be me)
Specially equities, reckon we smile
Interfere, tech to tech and use the TEC that we wile
Detective deceptive, receptive of fouls
Hectic, Heckler & Koch
Helicopters on the set of my sales
Nah, I ain't gonna be embedded in jail
Talking to a cellmate in a bed in a jail, dog
I broke bread with the whale, fled from some seals (what else?)
And the house, I was the head of the hills, shit
You get a dumb ho, and get dumb-happy
Go to the gun show, get gun-happy (who are we?)
Stuck, killed, mugged, milled
Tone, flint, sticks, bo, Chub's milk (what up, y'all)
Pucci baba, but I got the hardest shells
We the Midwest gun cartel, nigga (nigga)
Ya, we'll just clap up your brains, snatch up your chains
See dog? Rap is my aim
But I'm a hustler, in my heart, trapped is the game
Attached to my frame, tapped to my brain, the fact still remains:
It wasn't rap, it was crack that got the racks on the Range
Look dog, don't be asking for Dame, see
Playboy, I don't own that man
And anyway, homeboy, you a grown-ass man, shit
And when I rap it ain't no punchline (not at all)
I be on the highway dirty, crunch time
No timeouts homeboy, just one time
If they find that stash box just one time
Shit, they'll put the dogs in the truck
Side of the road, holding you up, you cold as a fuck
They want that button, lunge it and push it
Soon as they lunge it and push it, I run in the bushes
That's how I play mine, jump over the grapevine
Take my chances one-on-one with the K9
Steel and a clip for anyone squealing they lips
Fuck y'all if y'all ain't feeling the Dips (Killa, Killa!)

Why I feel like I'm losing weight?
Why I ain't got no money if I'm moving weight?

Doctor C

[Verse 1]
Yo, I plan to build myself a facility before I'm forty
A molecular archeogenetic laboratory
That can analyze complex poetry data for me even if it was recorded poorly
How extraordinary
I frog leap over awkward beats
Then I separate rappers by their Carbon-14's
To determine the age of anything ever made
Regardless of how the outside surface has changed
I put a curse on your name, bombard your brain
With gamma X-rays 'til you burst into flames
With the scientifically quantifiable megalomaniacal viable style
It's like trying to ride a bull
Let's have a dictionary duel after school
Check me into a nice Cedars-Sinai room
So I can get sick as the flu, spittin' the truth
If you ain't got this album, you missing the proof
Prepare for your doom my nuclear rocket plumes
Glow against the pale background of the Moon
Toxic fumes spoil complete stocks of fruits and foods
Burning your flammable boxes of booze
Got in the groove even though I'm not in the mood
Motherfucker you didn't win 'cause I can't lose
Give the fans the chance to choose, fuck you!
Who's the illest? Who's it really up to?
Rapping fire, you better run for the pacifier
Tie you up and drown you in the saliva quagmire
'Til your oxygen expires and your lungs dry up
Cause you said Bis ain't dope, you a damn liar
Disaster for hire over beats by Kyros
Flow like the Tigris, Euphrates with the eye of the tiger in my iris
Canibus is a fighter
Motherfucker, my great grandfather was Irish
Let's roll the dices, I'll break you like young Tyson
Give me the mic man, I don't need no hype man
Put a thousand on me, put one on him
I tear off his limbs, throw him in and tell him to swim
Yo, I soak that sugar-coated shit in soy sauce
Tell the FCC boss, turn that noise off
Call Detroit's Mafia Boss
Tell him, ""Yo, I got a job for you, I want you to bust his balls""
Drop him off by Niagara Falls
Write my name on a banana and put the banana between his jaws
Nobody disrespects lyrical law
I'm the best there ever is and the best ever was
Training like a grunt face down in the mud
With blood, sweat, and tears, sucking it up
Yo, you wonder where I am right now?
I'm probably somewhere on the microphone fucking it up
Dead or alive, Canibus will live through the rhyme
To be the illest on the mic is a mission of mine
Spittin' divine, you can't get it twisted this time
Vocal with a mirror to make sure my lips align
Doctor C, Ph. D, graduated from UMG
Bright as the LCD display on a new MP
Prototype of a true MC
With 3D topography maps you can't see
Butcher on Broad Street, wrapping CD's
In butcher paper, doing artwork with Sharpies
If you don't like the quality, then talk to me
What the fuck you on the website for you creep?
Punching the keys, remember that sound
That's exactly what it sounds like when I'm punching your teeth
Kick a rap, bitch, if you've got the gumption to speak
Stand next to me, I might put a lump in your meat
Diss you and your man, double the beef
To tell you the truth, I thought your rebuttal was weak
Round the outside, blah blah, et cetera et cetera

To the man behind the zipper, and then I flip her
You could ask the strippers, I'm a very good tipper

Brooklyn Go Hard,rap,JAY-Z,2008,261382,{Santigold},"[Intro: Santigold]
Brooklyn— Brooklyn— Brooklyn— Brooklyn
Brooklyn, we go hard
We go hard

Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard (Agh!)
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard (Go hard)

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
This is black hoodie rap
There's no fear in my eyes where they lookin' at
Better look on map
Besides, me nah like to eye fight
Me nah think such a ting is worth a man's life (Christ!)
But if a man test my Stuy
I promise he won't like my reply
Boom-bye-bye, like Buju, I'm crucial
I'm a Brooklyn boy, I may take some gettin' use to
Chain snatchin', ain't have it, gotta get it
Same shiddit, from Brownsville to Bainbriddidge
Fatherless child, Mama pulled double shifts
So the number runners was the only ones I hanged widdith
Before you know it I'm in the game, bang fiddith
Fear no orangutans, piddeel ciddaps
Like oranges-es, I'm dangerous
Please! Tell me what the name of this shit

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I father, I Brooklyn-Dodger them
I jack, I rob, I sin
Aw, man—I'm Jackie Robinson
'Cept when I run base, I dodge the pen
Lucky me, luckily, they didn't get me
Now when I bring the Nets, I'm the Black Branch Rickey
From Brooklyn corners, burnin' branches of sticky
Spread love, Biggie; Brooklyn, hippie
I pity the fool with jewels like Mr. T
With no history in my borough, they borrow
With no intentions of returnin' tomorrow
The sun don't come out for many, like Annie
Half-orphan, Mama never had an abortion
Papa sort of did; still, I managed to live
I go hard, I owe it all to the crib
Now please tell me, what the fuck's harder than this?

[Verse 3: Santigold]
While I'm doin' my time due to circumstance
Cross that bridge, face the consequence
Once bid ten, now I paid my dues
Risk takers, we break the rules
Get so dark, but I see good
Bed-Stuy stay high in my neck of the woods
Now, let it ring out, it's a warnin'
(Brooklyn!) Let it be sworn in
Gotta make it stick workin' like we blue collar
Rip it to the core, underneath it all we harder
Right into the clip, bring it to the floor
One step, one step, give it up more
The road is rough and the street's a mess
Got big cash dreams and a sick death wish
Robbin' out the commercial stash
Kill the voice screamin' in my head

Juicy,rap,The Notorious B.I.G.,1994,3528473,{},"[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G.]
(""Fuck all you hoes!"" Get a grip, motherfucker!)
Yeah, this album is dedicated
To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothin'
To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin' in front of
Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter (it's all good)
And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed in Bambú, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood, it's all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
[Chorus: Total & Puff Daddy]
You know very well (Yeah)
Who you are (Money, hoes and clothes)
Don't let 'em hold you down (Bankrolls, yeah, haha)
Reach for the stars (It's all good)
You had a goal (C'mon)
But not that many (It's all good)
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty (Check it)

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Moët and Alizé keep me pissy, girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rapping stuff
I was too used to packing gats and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Living life without fear
Puttin' five karats in my baby girl ear
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
[Chorus: Total & Puff Daddy]
You know very well (C'mon)
Who you are (Bankrolls)
Don't let 'em hold you down (Clothes)
Reach for the stars (Mansions)
You had a goal
But not that many (It's all good)
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty ('94)

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this
50-inch screen, money-green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is loungin'
Celebrating every day, no more public housin'
Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps an Ac' with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip Champagne when we thirsty
Uh, damn right I like the life I live
'Cause I went from negative to positive and it's all (It's all good, nigga)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
[Chorus: Total, The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
You know very well (Money)
Who you are (Hoes and clothes)
Don't let 'em hold you down (Bankrolls)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
Reach for the stars (That's right)
You had a goal (It's all good)
But not that many (All good)
'Cause you're the only one (East coast, represent)
I'll give you good and plenty (C'mon)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

Representin' B-Town in the house (Biggie Smalls)
Junior Mafia, mad flavor (Bad Boy)
Uh, uh, yeah, aight (I see you, Cooch)

[Intro: Puff Daddy]
Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil, for you are with me
Your rod and your staff, they comfort me
You prepare a table for me, in the presence of my enemies
You anoint my head with oil, my cup overflows
Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Niggas in my faction don't like askin' questions
Strictly gun-testin', coke-measurin'
Givin' pleasure in the Benz-ito
Hittin' fanny, spendin' chips at Manny's
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats
Run up in your crib, wrap you in your Polo sheets
Six up in your wig-piece, nigga deceased
Muah, may you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
Four-four and fifty-four draw
As my pilot, steers my Lear; yes, my dear
Shit's official, only the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your bloodclaat cryin'
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin', no lyin'
So don't you get suspicious
I'm Big dangerous, you're just a Lil Vicious
As I leave my competition, respirator style
Climb the ladder to success escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all
Death controls y'all, Big don't fold y'all, uhh
I spit phrases that'll thrill you
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you

You're nobody, 'til somebody, kills you

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Uhh, uhh
Watch Casino, I'm the hip-hop version of Nicky Tarantino
Ask Nino, he know
Green with envy, the green tempts me
To make the rich the enemy, and take their cheese
Take their spots, take their keys, make my faculty
Live happily ever after in laughter
Hah, never seen Cristal pour faster
And to those bastards, knuckleheads squeeze lead
Three of mine dead, nothin' left to do
But tear they ass to shreds, leave 'em in bloodshed
Incidents like this, I take trips
Lay up in Miami with Tamika and Tammy (huh)
Some Creole C-O bitches I met on tour
Push a peach Legend Coupe, gold teeth galore (say what?)
Told me meet 'em in the future later
They'll take me shoppin', buy me lavender and fuschia Gators
Introduce me to playa haters and heavy weighters
Rich bitch shit, drinkin' Cristal 'til they piss the shit, uhh
Thorough bitches, adapt to any borough bitches
Be in spots where they were no bitches, you feel me
Reminisce on dead friends too
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you

You can be the shit, flash the fattest five (that's right)
Have the biggest dick, but when your shell get hit
You ain't worth spit, just a memory
Remember he used to push the champagne Range (I 'member that)
Silly cat, wore suede in the rain
Swear he put the G in game, had the Gucci frame
Before Dana Dane, thought he ran with Kane
I can't recall his name (what was his name?), you mean that kid
That nearly lost half his brain over two bricks of cocaine?
Gettin' his dick sucked by Crackhead Lorraine?
A fuckin' shame, duke's a lame, what's his name?

I don't know
The fuck wrong with you, bitch?

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
When I met you, I admit, my first thoughts was to trick
You look so good, huh, I suck on your daddy's dick
I never felt that way in my life
It didn't take long before I made you my wife
Got no rings and shit, just my main squeeze
Comin' to the crib, even had a set a keys
During the days you helped me bag up my nickels
In the process, I admit, I tricked a little
But you was my bitch, the one who'd never snitch
Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy fuckin' rich

Moonlight strolls with the hoes, oh, no, that's not my steelo

Packin' gats in a Coach bag, steamin' dime bags
A real bitch is all I want, all I ever had
With a bop just as strong as me
Totin' guns just as long as me, the bitch belongs with me
Any plans with another bitch, my bitch'll spoil it
One day, she used my toothbrush to clean the toilet
Throwin' my clothes out the windows, so when the wind blows
I see my Polos and Timbos
Hide my car keys so I can't leave
A real slick bitch, keep a trick up her sleeve
And if I deceive, she won't take it lightly
She'll invite me, politely, to fight, G

She helped me plan out my robberies on my enemies
Didn't hesitate to squeeze to get my life out of danger
One day, she put 911 on the pager
Had to call back, whether it's minor or major
No response, the phone just rung
Grab my vest, grab my gun, to find out the problem
When I pulled up, police was on the scene
Had to make the U-turn, make sure my shit was clean
Drove down the block, stashed the burner in the bushes
Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes
It didn't take long before the tears start
I saw my bitch dead with the gunshot to the heart
And I know it was meant for me
I guess the niggas felt they had to kill the closest one to me
And when I find 'em your life is to an end
They killed my best friend, me and my bitch

If you wanna step to my motherfucking rep
Chk-chk, blaow, blaow, blaow, blown to death
You got shot 'cause you knock-knock-knock
""Who's there?"" Another motherfucking hard rock
Slacking on your macking 'cause raw's what you lack
You wanna react? Bring it on back (Back)
[Chorus]
Shame on you when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard, Brooklyn Zoo
Shame on you when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard, Brooklyn Zoo (Brooklyn Zoo, what?)
Shame on you when you step through to (My nigga)
The Ol' Dirty Bastard, Brooklyn Zoo
Shame on you when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard, Brooklyn Zoo
Shame on you when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard, Brooklyn Zoo

[Outro]
What? My nigga
Shame on you
Shame—
Shame on you when you step through to—
Shame on— Shame on—
Shame on you when you step through to—
Shame on you when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard, Brooklyn Zoo

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I used to get feels on a bitch
Now I throw shields on the dick to stop me from that HIV shit
And niggas know they soft like a Twinkie filling
Playing the villain, prepare for this rap killing
Biggie Smalls is the illest, your style is played out
Like Arnold on that, ""What you talking 'bout, Willis?""
The thrill is gone, the Black Frank White
Is here to excite and throw dick to dykes
Bitches I like 'em brainless, guns I like 'em stainless steel
I want the fucking fortune like the Wheel
I squeeze gats 'til my clips is empty
Don't tempt me, you don't want to fuck with the M-E...

[Verse 2: Method Man & The Notorious B.I.G.]
...T-H-O-D Man, here I am
I'll be damned if this ain't some shit
Come to spread the butter lyrics over hominy grit
It's the low killer death trap, yes I'm a jet-black ninja
Coming where you rest at, surrender
Step inside the ring, you's the number one contender
Looking cold-booty like your pussy in December
Nigga, stop bitching, button up your lip and
From Method all you getting is a can of ass-whipping
Hey, I'll be kicking you son, you doing all the yapping
Acting as if it can't happen
Your frontin' got me mad enough to touch something
Yo, I'm from Shaolin Island and ain't afraid to bust something
So what you want nigga? You won't nigga
I got a 6-shooter and a horse named Trigger
It's real, '94 rugged-raw
Kickin' down your goddamn door
And it goes a little something like this
[Chorus: Method Man & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
Everything you get you gotta work hard for it
(Honeys shake your hips) You don't stop
(And niggas pack the clips) Keep on, bitch

[Verse 3: Method Man & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Verse two, coming with that Olde E brew
Meth-tical, putting niggas back in ICU
I'm lifted, troop, you can bring your wack-ass crew
I got connections, I'll get that ass stuck like glue
Huh, no question, I be coming down and shit
Yo I gets rugged as a motherfucking carpet get
And niggas love it, not in the physical form but in the mental
I spark and they cells get warm
I'm not a gentleman, I'm a Method Man
Baby accept it, utmost respect it, and
(Assume the position) Stop look and listen
I spit on your grave then I grab my Charles Dickens, bitch

[Verse 4: The Notorious B.I.G. & Method Man]
Welcome to my center, honeys feel it deep in they placenta
Cold as the pole in the winter
Far from the inventor, but I got this rap shit sewed
And when my MAC unloads
I'm guaranteed another video
Ready to die, why I act that way?
Pop duke left mom duke, the faggot took the back way
So instead of making hoes suck my dick up
I used to do stick-ups, 'cause hoes is irritating like the hiccups
Excuse me, flows just grow through me
Like trees to branches, cliffs to avalanches
It's the praying mantis, deep like the mind of Farrakhan
A motherfucking rap phenomenon, plus
(I got more Glocks and TECs than you)
I make it hot, (niggas won't even stand next to you)
Nigga touch me you better bust me three times in the head
Or motherfucker's dead, you thought so
[Chorus: Method Man & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
And everything you get you gotta work hard for it
(Honeys shake your hips) You don't stop
(And niggas pack the clips) Keep on, bitch
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
Everything you get you gotta work hard for it
(Honeys shake your hips) You don't stop
(And niggas pack the clips) Keep on, bitch

Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique in full effect (Yeah, what the fuck you want, nigga?)

Im Gettin Money,rap,Fabolous,2008,13055,"{""Freck Billionaire""}","[Verse 1 - Freck Billionaire]
I'm gettin money, heres my explanation
The Lambo's milked out, no expiration
And I ain't ask for an estimation
I just pass the cake off, no hesitation
Ya' see I'm nothing like y'all guys
I just do the stuntin'
Y'all niggas fall guys
And everyday I get the Benny washed
It's Deja Vu, like Denny Wash
The budgets too big, Billionaire’ll hurt a label
Play it tight spray the creed on the Purple label
Pave' set me and Jacob got me linked up
The bentley wag' bullet proof, like a Brinks truck
CVL, we dont care what ya homies sell
Rubberbands round' the stacks like a ponytail
I could meet a ho sweeter than Damita Jo
She act conceited, though, her number get deleted, yo
I'm not a musician, but I play an instrument
The raging bull handle any kind of incident
The Black latex D’s can't get the prints
The Flying Spur so fly, I had to get the Bent
Got initials on the door scrappy
Initials on the floormats
I ain't braggin', homeboy, this my format
The 22’s look like they ridin' on four flats
Young octopus, I carry arms
[Verse 2 - Fabolous]
I'm gettin' money is my quotation
Family man so I need the Lambo station
Slick talk'll put a chamber into rotation
Directors style I shoot 'em on location
My hoes Haitian, Trini and Croatian
Ass clap louder than a Oprah ovation
Double D's on her chest like Dare Devil
Her shoe game's at a nine hundred a pair level
I'm in P-rada the color of Ri-cotta
Cheese? Please, you can't tell me nada
I don't share keys nor do I give her codes
I set run through records down on River Road
Then I switched up, posted on Palisade
The Denali stay smellin' like Cali grade
A couple Bond Number 9 squirts
Osama Rich--that's the hard-to-find shirt
Your rocks keep to they self? Well mines flirt
They too clean, board of health couldn't find dirt
I'm rich bitch and I'm screamin' it like Ashy Larry
They call me Brinks boy. Maybe it's the cash I carry
Rubber bands pop you gon' need a scrunchee for me
If she a jumpoff, bet the chick bungee for me
I came a long way and I still stroll the avenues
Move in style, Louis V, rollin' travel
Local nigga, you never been to Poland have you?
So you couldn't judge me if you was holding gavels
And I used to get the raw from Bolivia
That was back when Raven Simone was Olivia
I did the take out, meaning that I ran orders
I had the transporters sittin' by the land borders
The Rockefeller make you rather do a manslaughter
They goin' in juniors, comin' home with granddaughters
So homie if you got a weapon, tote it
You can't jump ship niggas won't accept you boat it
When I was doin it for TV I kept it loaded
Cause these hatin' niggas tryna' final episode it
A half a clip in ya hip'll make ya Elvis shake
You'll more than moan when the bones in ya' pelvis break
Bentley drop cost 200 and 12 to take

Not Give a Fuck,rap,Fabolous,2003,28037,{},"I'm somethin' like a phenomenon
But still dumpin' whenever the drama's on
Y'all hustlers can't eat fit meals
And it feels somethin' like when it's Ramadan
Hope you chumps been walkin' with armor on
I'm who they dumping 2 Cole Hamels on
Somethin's turnin' this momma on
I love to see rumps in Ferragamo thongs
Bet it look plump when you got pajamas on
Jump in, let's hit the Bahamas ma
And it's crunk whenever I'm on the song
Bumpin' like ""Bumb-ba-Bump""
I'm particularly picky
When it come to licky licky
Have 'em slidin' off them Vickies quickly
Under the doo-rag thick three sixty
It's the hypno and sticky icky
I said Okay!

[Hook]
Fly enough, to do better
But pimp enough to not give a fuck
Thug enough, to do better
And gangsta enough to not give a fuck
I'm hustlin' enough, to know better
But ballin' enough to not give a fuck
Old enough, to know better
But young enough to not give a fuck
D-d-d-d-dammit man
I'm in a throwback so old
It'll make your grandma glance
And everybody know, everybody go
So please, call the stretch ambulance
These dudes don't stand a chance
When I pull up like the pamper brand
Doors in the Lambo slants
With a madame from France
With a ass so big
You couldn't hide it in Hammer pants
Who else be in New York
With Miami tans
Got everybody doin' the Street Family dance
I'm sure this hammer can
Make you save that gangsta role for the camera man
It's F-A-B, you preferably
Don't wanna F wit me (Please believe it)
I'm definitely as responsible
For getting the City High as Clef would be (Believe it please)

[Hook]

I'm introduced to your women friends (Hello)
Cause I buy double deuces to rim a Benz
Like they boots made by Timberland
I have to remind, since I got drafted and signed
Ya'll playa's get used to the scrimagin'
Now one of the Jesuses got lemon gems? (Damn)
Know y'all lips get loose like y'all feminine
I prove letting loose with the semi can boost my adrenaline
You never had no use with that limb again
Half my roots is Dominican
Faboloso mi gusto les Benjamins
This dude got the juice of a pimp in him
Turn to stones like Medusa had glimpsed at him
But right now you can lie and gossip too
And later be the guy who the mas run to
And right now you can try to prosecute
But later on you gonna die in the hospital
